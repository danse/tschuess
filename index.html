    because nobody says "Auf Wiedersehen" in real life

    Well yes. After more than one year in preparation and experiments,
    it's finally happening: i left my flat and i am going to do the
    Abmeldung and fly back to Sicily. No, we have Winter also in
    Sicily. And no, i actually love Berlin, it's great!
  </div>
  <div class="action main">
    There are many people i thought of in the past months, and i had
    no time to meet. I would like to say you goodbye before
    disappearing for a while! Please join me for drinks on the 24th or
    25th of November, from 19:00, at Fischer's Vogel. I will be there
    until 21:00, and then probably move elsewhere for dinner. My phone
    number is +49 176 315 66 258 in case you'll need it

    <div class="dialogue-question">
      What? Two days?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-answer">
      Yeah. Well there is a lot of people i would like to see and chat
      with, so i thought that picking two days, most of you will be
      free to have a drink at least for one of the dates
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    I can't fully wrap my head around the idea of leaving, i keep
    thinking about people i want to meet, things i want to do here and
    places i want to check out, so i apologise for not being very
    present, in the back of my head i still think i'll have a lot of
    time, and the bureaucracy has got priority over fun in the last
    months, and i'm terribly slow with bureaucracy. Hopefully we will
    have an opportunity to quietly chat on the 24th or the 25th, and
    in case you can't make it, i surely hope to be back to Berlin
    soon!

    <div class="dialogue-question">
      How about Sicily? Is it any good?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-answer">
      Oh well, there are some good things there and some bad and ugly
      things. Hopefully i will put together a comfortable
      accommodation in some city on the East, and after that you will
      be all very welcome to be my guests!

  <div class="farewell">
    Hey, thanks you all for being so awesome with foreigners like
    me. Thanks for being empathetic and curious, and patient. I have
    learned a lot here, i had fun and i changed my perspective on many
    things. I hope to have spread some good karma here and there
    around the city as well. Here i could express myself with extreme
    freedom. I came looking for some values, and i found them. Now i
    really want these values to survive and get stronger, in Berlin
    and in me, and i am trying to do my part. I will miss you ...
  </div>
  <div class="farewell">
    And once in a while i will come here to recharge my batteries, and
    try to awkwardly get in touch with you again!
